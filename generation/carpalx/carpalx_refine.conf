#
# ACTION
#
# The action variable controls what the script does. The following
# options are available, and some require others to be present in
# order for the script to work.
#
# loadtriads - read the input corpus and parse its triads
#
# loadkeyboard - read the initial keyboard configuration
#
# optimize - using the input corpus (loadtriads) and the initial
#   keyboard configuration (loadkeyboard), attempts to minimize typing
#   effort by rearranging key location. Parameters for this process are
#   defined elsewhere in this file.
#
# reporteffort - report stroke frequency, typing effort and other
#   details of the current keyboard layout. If this action is called
#   before (after) optimize, then the report is based on the initial 
#   (optimized) keyboard layout. If you want to generate statistics
#   for an arbitrary (e.g. unoptimized, potentially optimized) keybard
#   layout, this option is for you.
#
# quit/exit - stop the script
#
# Some examples:
#
# action = loadkeyboard,loadtriads,reporteffort,quit 
#   generate statistics for input keyboard using the corpus
#
# action = loadkeyboard,loadtriads,optimize,quit
#    load the keybard and corpus and then optimize the keyboard layout
#
# action = loadkeyboard,loadtriads,optimize,reporteffort,quit
#    like above, but generate optimized keyboard statistics before quitting

action = loadkeyboard,loadtriads,optimize,quit

#action  = loadkeyboard,loadtriads,reporteffort,drawinputkeyboard,quit
#action = loadkeyboard,drawinputkeyboard,quit

# A random job identifier. You can use the value of this variable in other
# configuration variables to generate unique files for each run.

#
# TRAINING CORPUS
#
# The training corpus is the body of text that is used to optimize
# keyboard layout. Depending on your application, this may be a text or
# set of texts in your spoken language, perhaps a programming language
# if you want to torture yourself with an optimized layout for coding,
# or any other text that you find yourself needing to type a lot.
#
# The corpus will be parsed and triads extracted based on the
# setting of the "mode" variable. You can limit the number of triads
# extracted (triad_max_num, useful for short runs and debugging).#
# You also have the option to avoid rare triads (if triads_min_freq is
# set then only triads that appear at least this many times will be
# kept).
#
# Triads can be extracted to overlap if triads_overlap is set.
#
# triad_overap = yes    school -> sch,cho,hoo,ool
# triad_overap = no     school -> sch,ool

corpus  = corpus.txt

# For definition of modes, see modes.conf

################################################################
# 
# WORD-BASED STATISTICS
#
# The action "wordreport" will generate a report of word efforts,
# based on words found in the file defined here. You can limit the
# length of the words to a range. 
#
# The purpose of the report is to generate a ranked-order list of
# words that are easy-vs-hard to type. 
#
# Note that these words do not play a role in keyboard layout
# optimization - they are used for reporting efforts.

#
# KEYBOARD DEFINITION
#
# The parameters here (keyboard_*) define the input keyboard, which is
# used for reporting initial typing effort and, if requested, is used
# as the base layout for optimization. See keyboards/README for
# a description of how the keyboard input files are formatted. 
#
# keyboard_input defines the input keyboard.
#
# keyboard_output defines the filename that stores the current
# (e.g. current best) layout during optimization. The format of this
# file is the same as expected by keyboard_input, which makes it
# possible to resume a job.
#
# keyboard_output_show_parameters defines which parameters to embed in
# the keyboard_output file.

# KEYBOARD REPORTING AND IMAGE (PNG)
#
# This family of parameters controls how frequently the current
# keyboard layout is reported to file (report_*) during the optimization stage. You can
# generate a PNG image of the current keyboard layout (draw_*).
#
# Carpalx reports the progress of the simulation to the terminal based on stdout_* parameters.
